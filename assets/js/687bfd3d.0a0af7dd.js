Today, I took the time to refactor them into `helios.math.core`.\\n\\nBy isolating these core components, I hope to ensure a more fine grained soc right from the beginning. And speaking of optimization, I dep now on [Google Benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark) and put `mat4` to the test.\\nThe power house surely is [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) (OpenGL Mathematics  library), which I frequently used. However, to get a hang of C++ I decided to implement some of the (basic) requirements myself.\\n\\nHere\'s a look at the numbers:\\n\\n<center>\\n![](img/benchmark_mat4.png)\\n</center>\\n\\nIn both constructor and multiplication tests, the helios implementation shows a promising performance - granted, I\'m nowhere close to the optimizations of glm which sports much, much more functionality than my basic implementations, but its nonetheless nice to see how the two compare.\\n\\n### Benchmarking Guid Pointer To Implementation\\n\\nRemember my bold claim about the[performance drawbacks of pointer-to-implementation and heap allocation](/devlog/helios-engine-foundation)? I\u2019ve put together a benchmark [here](https://github.com/garagecraft-games/helios/blob/main/benchmarks/helios/util/Guid.benchmark.cpp), comparing the regular and PIMPL versions. As expected, the latter comes with a noticeable performance hit:\\n\\n\\n| Benchmark                        | Time| Time (CPU) | Iterations |\\n|----------------------------------|------------------|------------|------------|\\n| BM_GuidGenerate                  | 8.70 ns          | 8.40 ns    | 83,743,377 |\\n| BM_GuidPimplGenerate             | 92.3 ns          | 92.7 ns    | 7,920,792  |\\n\\n\\n## A New Workflow: CLion and CMake\\nI\u2019m parting ways with MSVS (for now) and embracing a more automated, cross-platform workflow with CLion and CMake. The goal is to let modern tooling take care of the heavy lifting, especially with dependency management: It turned out that incorporating Google Benchmark was too much of a hassle (for me at last), but CMake did the trick in no time. I also feel pretty much right at home coming from [composer](https://getcomposer.org), [packagist](https://packagist.org) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com).\\n\\n\\n<center>\\n![](img/screenshot.png)\\n</center>\\n\\n\\nIt wasn\'t without its challenges, and I\'m still navigating the learning curve, but the potential benefits in productivity and project maintainability are promising.\\n\\n## Join Me on the Journey\\nI streamed this entire process live on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/garagecraft_games).

This weekend, I ~eased~ dove headfirst into that foundation for my personal C++ engine project, *Helios*, and it was a fantastic journey through the nuances of modern C++ design.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\n### Starting with a Clean Slate: C++20 Modules\\nFrom the beginning, I decided to build Helios on a modern footing, which meant embracing C++20 modules. Leaving the legacy of `#include` behind, explicit dependency graphs with `import` and `export` are the goal. Solving a few issues solidified a key lesson: with modules, build scripts are as much a part of your architecture as your C++ code (even though the prospect of a legacy audit makes me a little nervous) .\\n\\n### The `vec3` Story: More Than Just Three Floats\\nThe first real piece of the engine was the humble `vec3`. Sounds simple, right? Yet it became the perfect canvas for exploring modern C++ features. The goal wasn\'t just to make it work, but to make it efficient, so that hundreds operations in between frames can be run in the shortest time possible.\\n\\nI wrapped my head around [`constexpr`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constexpr.html), amongst others, and used it where applicable: constructors, the `operator[]`, and other accessors were all designed to be usable at compile time, which allows for defining constant vectors like world axes or colors that are baked directly into the program, with zero runtime cost[^static_assert].\\n\\n[^static_assert]: It also enables compile-time validation with [`static_assert`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/static_assert.html), catching bugs before the code even runs.\\n\\n### The Guid Lesson: Choosing the Right Tool\\nNext up was a system for unique object identification. My first instinct for the [`Guid` class](https://github.com/garagecraft-games/helios/blob/main/src/helios/util/Guid.cpp) was to hide the implementation details using the **Pimpl idiom** (_Pointer to Implementation_)[^pimpl]. It\u2019s a classic pattern for reducing compile-time dependencies.\\n\\n[^pimpl]: See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opaque_pointer (retrieved 17.08.2025)\\n\\nWell, as much as I like the concept behind the [Bridge Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_pattern) and its usage in C++, it was completely the wrong tool for this job: Due to the way the memory is allocated for the referenced data structure (additional heap-allocation for every `Guid` that gets created) and due to the fact that a [pointer indirection](https://www.it.uc3m.es/pbasanta/asng/course_notes/pointers_indirection_with_pointers_en.html) for every single `Guid` would be incurred. For a scene graph with many identifiable nodes, this would impose avoidable performance overhead.\\n\\nI scrapped the Pimpl (heh!) and rebuilt Guid as a simple, efficient class wrapping a `uint64_t`. It should be as cheap to use as an `int` - benchmarks tba.\\n\\n<center>\\n![](img/guid.png)\\n</center>\\n\\n### What\'s Next?\\nThe foundation is now in place. I\'m striving for a small math and utility library before I go back to rendering and OpenGL. The process has been a deep dive into not just how C++ features work, but why they are designed the way they are.\\n\\nThe next step is to build on these bricks - to create a scene graph, a Node aggregate, and begin tackling the renderer itself. But I\'ll do so with the confidence that the code it all rests is solid - and, more important - maintainable.\\n\\n----------------"},{"id":"lost-in-translation","metadata":{"permalink":"/devlog/lost-in-translation","source":"@site/devlog/2025-08-16-lost-in-translation/index.md","title":"Lost in Translation","description":"My background is in the web world - I\'ve spent years wrangling Java, JavaScript (and countless frameworks based on it), PHP (from Zend to Laravel over Symfony and self-written solution), and the closest I ever got to the metal was writing C, of which I thought it would give me a head start for a game engine project.

The language demands a completely different level of discipline. Suddenly, it\'s not just about maintaining memory, it\'s also about ownership. The concept of smart pointers, and the critical role of a destructor is a universe away from the cozy safety of a [garbage collector \u2764\ufe0f](https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/java/gc01/index.html) or `==` out of the box. (I now understand the motivation behind Java better.)\\n\\nAnd that\'s before you even get to the build process: No more _save and refresh_ and _hot reloads_. Here, you enter a three-act play with the compiler, the linker, and a mysterious director named VisualStudio 2022 and its ever so confusing tree menus and option dialogs.
