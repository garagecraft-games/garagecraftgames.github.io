I\u2019ve designed systems, worked with teams of various sizes, and treated software development as a true [craft](https://thorsten.suckow-homberg.de/docs/articles/software-craftsmanship). But sometimes, a single problem can change your entire perspective.

It was the final push, the moment that solidified a long-brewing passion: It made me decide to dive into the world of game development.\\n\\nAs a software developer, I\'m captivated by the interplay of design, modular components, optimization, and the final polish that turns code into a seamless experience. Game development feels like a very special expression of this craft: It\u2019s a field where the formal elegance of linear algebra directly creates the visual magic of computer graphics, where every line of code contributes to an interactive world.\\n\\nIt\u2019s the perfect fusion of technical challenge and creative artistry.

It\u2019s about embracing the hobbyist spirit, the joy of building something from the ground up, and celebrating the art of software craftsmanship in a different medium. A creative space to explore, learn, and share game development.\\n\\nI hope you\u2019ll follow along, and even more so, I look forward to the day we can all jump into a game session together.\\n\\n <SocialLinks />\\n\\nLet the journey begin,\\n\\nThorsten."}]}}')}}]);
