[**helios**](https://helios.garagecraft.games) is a custom game ~~engine~~ framework built from first principles, written in C++.

## Project Overview

helios is an educational project to explore the intricacies of game engine architecture. Each component is built from first principles: The primary goal is to apply and analyze modern software engineering in a performance-critical domain while implementing the mathematical building blocks of 2D and 3D graphics.

The framework strives for a modern C++20 module-based architecture, providing a clean and robust dependency graph for fast compilation. The initial rendering backend is implemented using **OpenGL**.

## Development Focus

The development process emphasizes understanding both the mathematical foundations and the rationale behind established patterns - trade-offs between indirect and direct data storage, the division of labor between CPU-side culling and GPU-side clipping, and how architectural decisions impact performance.

Current systems include rendering with scene graphs, input management, math libraries, and an event-driven application layer.
