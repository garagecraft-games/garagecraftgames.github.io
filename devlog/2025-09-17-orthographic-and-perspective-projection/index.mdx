Continuing from [my article on Model Matrix Rotations](/devlog/2025/09/02/model-matrix-rotations), I've written about projection matrices - one of the final steps before rasterization.

 <!--truncate-->

The [article](https://thorsten.suckow-homberg.de/docs/articles/computer-graphics/from-camera-to-clip-space-derivation-of-the-projection-matrices) derives both orthographic and perspective projection matrices, showing how view volumes in camera space are transformed into the canonical unit cube.
