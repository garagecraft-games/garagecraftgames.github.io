Following up on [my article on Model Matrices](/devlog/2025/08/26/model-matrix-transformations), I've written about matrix composition in the context of Model and Rotation matrices.

 <!--truncate-->

The [article](https://thorsten.suckow-homberg.de/docs/articles/computer-graphics/model-matrix-rotation-world-vs-local-origin) covers the difference between rotating around an object's own center (local space) versus rotating around a point in world space. It explains why matrix multiplication order matters, how to pre-calculate transformations for better performance, and how glm and Unity handle rotations.
