While porting the rotation matrices for `helios.math.transform`, I took a detour to understand the underlying linear algebra - I wanted to move beyond treating the rotational part of the model matrix as a black box.

 <!--truncate-->

I ended up writing an article that derives the model matrix as a change-of-coordinates transformation. It also shows why pre-rotating the matrix is equivalent to post-rotating the transformed vector. [Read it here](https://thorsten.suckow-homberg.de/docs/articles/computer-graphics/model-matrix-transformations-a-change-of-coordinates-perspective).
