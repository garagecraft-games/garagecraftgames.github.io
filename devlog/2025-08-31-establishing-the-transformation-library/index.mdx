`translate`, `rotate`, `scale` - done. They now live in [`helios.math.transform`](https://github.com/ThorstenSuckow/helios/tree/main/src/helios/math).

I standardized on post-multiplication (`M' = M * T`) to stay consistent with [`glm`](https://github.com/g-truc/glm). Transformations are applied in [local space](https://thorsten.suckow-homberg.de/docs/articles/computer-graphics/model-matrix-transformations-a-change-of-coordinates-perspective).

## `constexpr` - mostly
`translate` and `scale` are `constexpr`. `rotate` isn't - `sin`, `cos`, `sqrt` aren't `constexpr` in the standard library, so that's that for now.

I also skipped the temporary matrices for `translate` and `scale` and went with direct element-wise modification instead. Mathematically equivalent, slightly more efficient.

On to the rendering pipeline!
