Hi everyone!

I've been working in [software development](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thorstensuckow/) for a long time now - mostly frontend architecture, large-scale web applications, that kind of thing. I care a lot about [software craftsmanship](https://thorsten.suckow-homberg.de/docs/articles/software-craftsmanship) and building systems that actually make sense.

But then [Day 15 of Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/15) happened.

<!--truncate-->

That warehouse robot puzzle (pictured above) was the tipping point. I'd been thinking about game development for a while, but solving that problem made me realize: I want to do this.

What draws me in is the combination of technical depth and visual feedback. Linear algebra becomes something you can see on screen. Architecture decisions directly affect how a game feels. It's software development, but in a completely different context.

So I'm starting [garagecraft games](/).

It's a space for me to learn game development from the ground up - building a C++ framework, figuring out rendering pipelines, making mistakes, and documenting the process.

I hope you'll follow along.

Let the journey begin,

Thorsten.
