## Prototyping the Rendering Pipeline

As [announced in a previous post](/devlog/2025/09/28/onwards-to-the-rendering-model), I've made progress on the rendering pipeline. The `SceneGraph` and `RenderPass` system are in place now, separating scene graph traversal from the actual rendering commands.

 <!--truncate-->

I added a `RenderPassFactory` that takes a scene `Snapshot` and converts it into `RenderCommands`. The goal was to decouple what's in the scene (meshes, materials) from how it gets rendered. It's working, though there's room for improvement - but I'm avoiding feature creep for now.

Here's the basic flow:

```
create SceneGraph -> take Snapshot -> create RenderPass
                                               ||
                                               \/
        process by RenderingDevice <- extract RenderQueue
```

The `RenderingDevice` iterates over the `RenderQueues` and processes the `Renderables`, which is where the actual rendering happens.

Next up: generating doxygen documentation and integrating the input subsystem. I'm using helios as the framework for a semester assignment at [Trier University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hochschule-trier.de), so having proper documentation is becoming important.
