## Finishing milestone_1

I've published an accompanying technical report on my game framework **helios** that outlines the key architectural decisions behind the prototype and discuss its further development.

The report examines the development progress through the first milestone, highlights architectural decisions, and reflects on implementation challenges - with a deliberate focus on system design considerations.

It explores the use of agile Tracer Bullet Development, the advantages of SOLID principles during prototyping, and the tension between expressive object-oriented semantics and efficient data-oriented design (DOD) - an approach increasingly established in modern, performance-optimized game engines.

I look forward to using this document upon project completion as a critical reflection, helping to make the insights gained throughout the development process transparent.
